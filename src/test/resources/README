DTAR020_F8-modified.bin is the original DTAR020_F8.bin, modified to
support testing redefines: We redefine the DTAR020-KCODE-STORE-KEY to
be readable as a single 10-char string. For that, the STORE_NO must
consist of bytes that are valid EBCDIC-US codes. Hence we replace the
020c (+20.0) with 815c (+815.0 as a number or "a*" as a string) and
825c (+825.0 or "b*").

Keeping the original DTAR020_F8.bin here for reference, even though
it is not used by the tests.
